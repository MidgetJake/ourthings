Queue based JavaScript framework

# Intro

ourthings is a queue based javascript framework designed to take the legwork out of AJAX apps. Originally a closed
commercial framework,  we are rewriting it and giving it to the world.

# What does it do

After creating ajax site after site we realised that we were repeating the same blocks of code, over and over and 
always ending up in the same code tangle. Do this, then do this, do that, then call this same piece of code but do
something slightly different. After boiling down what we did it became obvious that what every app needed was:

* A queue system
* Flexible code blocks that can be reused
* Common method of passing data between code and UI
* Way to stop coders breaking the UI responsiveness

We also wanted to detach the framework from a need to use javascript. Our UX designers were spending time either
writing bad javascript or having to get coders involved for even the most basic of tasks. Thus we wanted to give HTML/CSS users access
to the framework in a language they already understand.
